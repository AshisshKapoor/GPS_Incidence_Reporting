The Inspection solution for Microsoft Teams is a general inspection app that can be used to inspect anything from a location—such as a retail store or manufacturing plant—to assets and equipment, such as vehicles and machines. There are two apps in this solution, each intended for different kinds of users.

### Key features
* **Inspection:** Enables front line workers to inspect an asset or area to manage quality of products and services or maintain safety at workplace
* **Communication:** Facilitates communication between team members to address issues found during inspection
* **Reporting:** Provides simple reports for managers to expedite issue resolution and highlight trends
